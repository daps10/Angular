Definition ::  (app.component.ts => app.component.html)

Angular interpolation is used display a component property in the respective view 
template with double curly braces syntax. We can display all kind of properties 
data into view e.g. string, number, date, arrays, list or map.


1) string :: 

    in component we just use string with variables n all.
    we didn't need to use var, let const keyword.

2) functions ::

    - for functions do not need to use function keyword.
    - just start function bellow way.
        test () {
            return true;
        }
3) Objects ::
    - we can use objects same as the we can use in the javascript.
    - like this way we can use 
        object = {
            key : value
        }
    
4) Array :: 
    - for array we can use like the [a,aa,aaa] way.
    - Whenever we wants some key's value then we can call it.

5) Arithmatics ops. 

    - we can also do the Arithmatics 


6) how can we get current location ::
    - like we do in the javascript we can use it same here but in component.ts
    file.

    Example :: 
    siteUrl = window.location.href;
