@Input, @Output, and EventEmitter

Data exchange from parent to child

=> Testing 1 :: 

    - Passing data from the app.component.ts file to the child component.
    - For that pass data in the app.component.html file to like bellow way ::
        <app-child-component [hel]="data" ></app-child-component>

    - In child component.ts file fetched the input from the @input directives
        @Input() hel: any;

    - In child.component.html file use the {{<input params>}} to get values.      


    => For the better approach created parent child components.
        - In app.component.ts file called the parent tags.
        - In that tag we can call the child component.


Reusable component in angular.

    => We can also use the for each towards the parent to child data pass.
