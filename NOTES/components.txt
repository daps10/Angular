    - What is Components ?
    
    - Understand Components.

        - 4 files in Components ?
    
    - Edit Components.

    - Make new Component.


- All the component we wanna make that all created in the app component then we can use them.

- When you create new component at that time automatically created 4 files.
    - app.component.html    (All html code)
    - app.component.css     (All css code)
    - app.component.specs.ts
    - app.component.ts      (All logical parts, calling api, declare function n all.)


- component's name always add in the component.ts fle.

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',                   //component name defined
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',    // html template file name.
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']      // css template file name.
    })
    
- Load component in the html file for that always remember the which component you wanna add.

- After that checked component later that particular component can use in the app like bellow way.
    <app-root></app-root>

    so this way we can fetch that component.


// Make new component :: 

    command :: ng generate component your-component-name-here
    short command :: ng g c <componentname>


    Through above command you can create component .


// how can we use new component in existing file.

    - For that you can do this with the selector name.
    - which is in the component.js file.
    - So selector file Through we can add that component.


// what if we don;t add component in main file.

    - its not effect in the html file.
    - just you can't use any component.ts file in the added componentfile.
