########### In this we can create function and called it.

How to call a function in angular 

    define function  :: 

    - You can define function in the app.component.js file.
    - So from this file whatever we can create that function we can call 
    in the app.component.html page
    

    Make button and call function on button click.

    - in app.component.html file we can create the html button like bellow way.
        <button (click) = "<function-name and without params>" > abc </button>
        <button (click) = "<abc()>" > abc </button>


    pass params with function call.

    - Same as the javascript if you wanna pass params in function call
    then you can pass like bellow way.

        <button (click) = "<function-name and with params>" > abc </button>
        <button (click) = "<abc(abc)>" > abc </button>

Note :: 
1. Always create function in same component only.



################### Important Events

1. started with create event function in the app.component.js file.

1) click() 
    on button click
2) keyup

    we can takes user enter values with the help of id.value 
    
    example ::
    <input type="text" #name (keyup)="getName(name.value)" />

    keyup.enter :: 
    with this way we can output while we press enter key.

    keyup.space :: 
    whenever we press space key at that time this will call.


3) keydown

    The keydown event is fired when a key is pressed. 
        (event performed first and value written down later)
    The keyup event is fired when a key is released.
        (event performed later and value written down first)

4) keyup with enter,space
5) keydown with enter,space
6) blur

    This event is called when we click outside of the box. such like 
    whenever we click outside of the input box at that time this event is fire,

7) mouseover and mouseleave

    The mouseover event is fired when a mouse come on that div.
    The mouseleave event is fired when a mouse leave that div.


8) get text value in angular :: 

    - get value with value change

        for this type of way we can use the 
        <input type="text" (keyup)="getVal($event)"/>

        and in component.ts file ::
        just pick the value from the "event.target.value"
        
    - get value with button click

        on button click get value for that we just need to add the id in the field
        and on that value we can get in the component side and set it.
